<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

<div class="biography-content">
  Hello! I am pursuing my M.S. degree in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/">Xi'an Jiaotong University</a>, where I was fortunate to be advised by Yonghong Song. Prior to that, I was a research intern at State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, and did my B.S. in Automation at Nanjing Normal University.

My primary research focus is on key information extraction from complex documents based on pre-trained models. Specifically, my research interests include: (i) designing semi-supervised frameworks to fine-tune pre-trained language models with a small amount of labeled data; (ii) continuously improving the quality of entity and relationship extraction from complex documents through large language models (LLMs).
