## Project Name

Web-Based Intelligent Document Information Extraction System (National Natural Science Foundation Project)

## Project Members

March 2024 - June 2024

## Project Description

The project aims to develop a complex document key information extraction system for named entity recognition and entity relationship extraction.

## Technical Implementation

1. **Multimodal Transformer Models**  
   Based on multimodal Transformer models such as LayoutLMv3, LiLT, and ERNIE, handling documents containing rich text, layout, and visual information, reducing the required parameters and overall computational load, and improving model efficiency.
2. **Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Models**  
   Fine-tuning pre-trained models on integrated public datasets or private datasets from multiple domains such as legal, financial, and medical fields uploaded by users.
3. **OCR-Assisted Correction Technology**  
   Utilizing OCR-assisted correction technology to preprocess and correct distorted text images.
4. **Natural Language Processing Libraries**  
   Integrating natural language processing libraries such as NLTK for pre-text processing tasks including text cleaning, tokenization, stop-word filtering, and stemming, efficiently handling text data, and improving text analysis efficiency.
5. **Data Annotation Platform**  
   Using a data annotation platform to label categories and relationships in small sample text data for training, returning document extraction results in JSON/image format for single images, and providing a visual interface for users to operate and view extraction results.

## Project Outcomes

Achieved an accuracy rate of 95% in invoice extraction, completing project assessment indicators three months ahead of schedule.
