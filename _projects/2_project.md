## Project Name

Knowledge Graph-Based Visual Question Answering System

## Project Role

Project Leader

## Project Duration

September 2022 - December 2022

## Project Description

Developed a knowledge graph-based visual question answering (VQA) system that performs VQA tasks using multimodal information.

## Technical Implementation

1. **Baseline and Ablation Studies**  
   Implemented the ZS-VQA structure as the baseline and conducted ablation studies on different modules. By training different feature mapping spaces—semantic space for relations, object space for supporting entities, and knowledge space for answers—the system could more accurately align image-question pairs and answers, improving VQA accuracy.
2. **Evaluation Metrics and Comparative Experiments**  
   Selected various evaluation metrics to assess the overall performance of the model. Designed comparative experiments and chose SAN as the fusion model to achieve optimal experimental results.
3. **Answering Explicit and Implicit Questions**  
   Through the knowledge graph, the system could answer questions based on explicit information and provide answers based on implicit knowledge, expanding the application scenarios and scope of the VQA system.
4. **Visualization and Human-Computer Interaction**  
   Provided knowledge graph visualization and VQA interface visualization, effectively realizing human-computer interaction.
